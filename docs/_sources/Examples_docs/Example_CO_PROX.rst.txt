PROX adsorption (Pt)
====================================

Introduction
------------

This example is mainly about adsorption of PROX reaction products and intermediate products on the surface of Pt, contributed by the developers of the project.

Inputs
------

The content of input file is as follow:

.. code-block::

    StrucInfo:
        file: POSCARfile
        struct:
            element: Pt
            lattype: fcc
            latcont: 4.16
            facet: [''] 
            dope:
                Cu: ['0']

    Model:
        SML: False
          ads:
			- ['OH',1]
			- ['O2',1]
			- ['H2',1]
			- ['H2O',1]
			- ['CO2',1]
			- ['CO',1]
		  coads:
			- ['O','H',1,1]

In the directory where the yaml file is located, use the command line to enter ads to generate 27 vasp structure files.

Results
-------
OH adsorption on POSCARslab substrate are construct with 3 configurations!

O2 adsorption on POSCARslab substrate are construct with 3 configurations!

H2 adsorption on POSCARslab substrate are construct with 3 configurations!

H2O adsorption on POSCARslab substrate are construct with 3 configurations!

CO2 adsorption on POSCARslab substrate are construct with 3 configurations!

CO adsorption on POSCARslab substrate are construct with 3 configurations!

O and H adsorption on POSCARslab substrate are construct with 9 configurations!

27 vasp structure files named "POSCARslab_x_i.vasp" (x is type of adsorbate,i from 0 to 9) are generated. The visualization results generated by VESTA are as follow:
