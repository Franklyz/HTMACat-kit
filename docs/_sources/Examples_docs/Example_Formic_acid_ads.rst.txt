Formic acid adsorption (Cu-doped Au)
====================================

Introduction
------------

This example is mainly about adsorption of formic acid on the surface of Cu-doped Au, contributed by the developers of the project.


Inputs
------

The content of input file is as follow:

.. code-block::

    StrucInfo:
      struct:
        element: Au
        lattype: fcc
        latcont: 4.16
        facet: ['111']
        dope:
        Cu: ['b1']

    Model:
      ads:
        - ['HCOOH',1]

In the directory where the yaml file is located, use the command line to enter ``htmat ads`` to generate 9 vasp structure files.

Results
-------
9 vasp structure files are generated. The visualization results generated by VESTA are as follow:
