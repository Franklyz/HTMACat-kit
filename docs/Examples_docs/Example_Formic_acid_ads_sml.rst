Formic acid adsorption (SMILES)
====================================

Introduction
------------

This example is mainly about adsorption of formic acid on the surface of Cu-doped Au, contributed by the developers of the project.


Inputs
------

The content of input file is as follow:

.. code-block::

    StrucInfo:
        struct:
            element: Au
            lattype: fcc
            latcont: 4.16
            facet: ['111']
            dope:
            Cu: ['b1']

    Model:
        SML: True
        ads:
            - ['C(=O)O',1]

In the directory where the yaml file is located, use the command line to enter ``htmat ads`` to generate 9 vasp structure files.

Results
-------
9 vasp structure files named "Au_Cu_111_b1_CH2O2_x.vasp" (x is from 0 to 8) are generated.
The visualization result of "Au_Cu_111_b1_CH2O2_0.vasp" generated by VESTA are as follow:
