Formic acid adsorption (building supercell)
====================================

Introduction
------------

This example is used to demonstrate the functionality of building supercell and multilayer slab 
with formic acid on Cu-doped Pt substrate, contributed by RxChen.


Inputs
------

The content of input file is as follow:

.. code-block::

    StrucInfo:
      struct:
        element: Au
        lattice_type: fcc
        lattice_constant: 4.16
        facet: ['111']
        supercell: [6,6]
        layers: 8
        dope:
        Cu: ['1']

    Model:
      ads:
        - ['HCOOH',1]

In the directory where the yaml file is located, use the command line to enter ``htmat ads`` to generate 4 vasp structure files.

Results
-------
4 vasp structure files are generated. The visualization results generated by VESTA are as follow:
